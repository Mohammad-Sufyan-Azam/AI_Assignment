Hey, my name is Sufyan and I am a 3rd year undergrad at IIITD. My goal is to become a Data Engineer. 
I have done courses like DBMS, PB, OS, TAIS, and MTL. I loved all of these courses and they provided me with a lot of 
valuable information on how things work at the grass root level of an AI system or the internet.Also, my CGPA is above 8. 
Can you suggest me some electives that can help me in achieving my goal?!
